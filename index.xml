      <title>Serverless package done right</title>

      <description>Problem The severless framework package command claims to be useful in CI/CD workflows. The command produces cloud formation stacks json files on disk that can be bundled and considered the &amp;lsquo;deployment artifacts&amp;rsquo; at the end of the pipeline. These artifacts can be provided to the serverless deploy command that could be run at a later date.
This two-step package/deploy process is very familiar, so I was lured into using the serverless package command.</description>

      <title>Squash Git Commits</title>

      <description>Ever made several commits on a feature branch and needed to rebase? Rebasing multiple commits can be tedious if there is a conflict from an early commit, requiring a commit resolution in every commit that follows. It can be practical, therefore, to squash multiple commits into a single commit before rebasing.
Ever wanted to clean up your commit history before pushing? I often make quick commits if I&amp;rsquo;m required to switch branches, or spiking an idea during development that ends up being permanent.</description>

      <description>Ever need to write a short script as part of development to get feedback on a portion of code? Ever need to add private authentication values to that script? Ever wanted to add the script to source control but couldn&amp;rsquo;t because it contained your private authentication?
 Enter: AWS Parameter Store
 This AWS service acts as a key-value store. Add your private settings such as usernames, passwords, connection strings etc and they can be retrieved programatically by their key name.</description>
