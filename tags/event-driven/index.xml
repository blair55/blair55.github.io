      <description>About the design  What problem inspired this work? RightResult is the SAAS incarnation of a game my friend would coordinate via emails and a spreadsheet.
Each week, he would email game members requesting predictions for the weekend&amp;rsquo;s English Premier League fixtures. Predictions and fixture results were entered into a spreadsheet. The scores would be tallied-up and communicated back to members. The winner was who had predicted most accurately.</description>
