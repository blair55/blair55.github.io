      <title>Serverless package done right</title>

      <description>Problem The Severless Framework package command claims to be useful in CI/CD workflows. The command results in the production of AWS Cloud Formation stack json files (or alternative cloud provider equivalent) on disk. These files can be bundled and considered the &amp;lsquo;deployment artifact&amp;rsquo; at the end of the pipeline. The artifact can be provided to the serverless deploy command that could be run at a later date.
This two-step package/deploy process is very familiar, so I was lured into using the serverless package command.</description>

      <description>Ever need to write a short script as part of development to get feedback on a portion of code? Ever need to add private authentication values to that script? Ever wanted to add the script to source control but couldn&amp;rsquo;t because it contained your private authentication?
 Enter: AWS Parameter Store
 This AWS service acts as a key-value store. Add your private settings such as usernames, passwords, connection strings etc and they can be retrieved programatically by their key name.</description>
