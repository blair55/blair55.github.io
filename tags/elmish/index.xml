      <description>About the design  What was the original problem that inspired this work? RightResult is the SAAS incarnation of a game my friend would coordinate via emails and a spreadsheet.
Each week, my friend would email game members requesting predictions for the weekend&amp;rsquo;s English Premier League fixtures. He would collate the responses and fixture results into a spreadsheet. The scores would be tallied-up and communicated back to the members. The winner was who had predicted most accurately.</description>
